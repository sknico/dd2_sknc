The full DD2 research data are based on data collected and linked from multiple sources (@Kristensen_ClinEpi_2024). This page gives an overview of the data structure, the data sources, and the definitions of data types. Detailed descriptions of each data source are provided on the following pages.

The data sources include **primary data**, i.e., data unique to DD2, including data and material collected from participants at enrollment, and additional primary data from nested research studies in the DD2 cohort. The data also include **secondary data**, i.e., external data collected from other data sources and then linked to DD2. In addition, DD2 data (primary and secondary data) are linked to the nationwide routine registry data located in centralized databases (SDS and DST) (@Kristensen_ClinEpi_2024).

# Primary data

Primary data can be split into two categories:

## 1. DD2 enrollment material
Everything collected during the DD2 enrollment (questionnaire responses, clinical measurements, and biological samples) constitutes the DD2 enrollment material and forms the foundation of DD2 as a distinct data source. This includes:


-   DD2 interview data (questionnaire)

-   Data from the clinical examination at enrollment

-   Blood and urine samples collected for storage in the DD2 biobank in Vejle.

Enrollment in DD2 involves completing the DD2 questionnaire, undergoing the clinical examination, and providing blood and urine samples. The DD2 cohort is defined by individuals who completed the enrollment process. These materials are unique to DD2 and are not available from other sources. All blood and urine samples are stored in the DD2 biobank and may be used for future research, though analysis typically depends on funding from specific studies.


## 2. Additional DD2 data

Research studies in the DD2 setup can generate new primary data. The completeness and availability of these primary data depend on when the studies are conducted and when results become available. The data are generated among individuals already enrolled in DD2, and are likely not collected during the initial enrollment process. This could e.g., be data from studies collecting additional follow-up DD2 data (by a follow-up questionnaire or follow-up clinical examinations) or from intervention studies using individuals from the DD2 cohort.      
The biological samples (blood and urine) are collected at enrollment and thus considered enrollment material. HOwever, they are stored in the biobank, and can be used for additional analyses in new research studies, e.g., biomarker analyses, genetic studies, or DNA sequencing. These analysis results add to the primary collected data by adding additional baseline information.

Examples of currently available additional DD2 data include

-   IDNC questionnaire data, a follow-up questionnaire from 2016 including (follow-up) questions from the initial questionnaire along with multiple questions concerning diabetic neuropathy.

-   IDA, DICTA, CsubT2D, etc., are examples of projects initiated within DD2. These projects generate their own additional data and analyses but data are still part of the overall DD2 setup.

-   QoL data. After enrollment, an e-mail with a questionnaire about quality of life (QoL) is sent to the individual. Additional follow-up questionnaires are sent after 2 years, 4 years, and 6 years. 

These data sources will most likely not be routinely updated with new individuals or additional data, as they are primarily generated as part of specific research projects with closed cohorts. The data can be accessed through collaboration with DD2 research groups.

# Secondary data

Secondary data refer to data from external but non-centralized data sources. They were not initially generated with the intention to be included in DD2. However, as they may be relevant to DD2 research questions, data from these external data sources are linked to the DD2. In practice, this means that data (or a subset of data) are transferred from the external data source to DD2, providing information on the individuals (or a subset of individuals) in DD2. Linkage to external data sources is crucial in DD2, as it allows for information about variables that are resource-intensive to collect in clinical practice and unavailable in the Danish health registries. We currently have data from the following external data sources:

-   The Danish Diabetes Database for Adults (DDDA, closed by June 2022)

-   The Danish National Podiatrist Registry (fodstatusdatabasen)

-   The Danish National Archive (Rigsarkivet), currently including birth data from midwife journals.

In general, updates from these sources may be possible, for example by extending follow-up periods or including additional individuals. The secondary data can be accessed through collaboration with DD2 research groups. Additional agreements may be established with Regionernes Kliniske Kvalitetsudviklingsprogram (RKKP) to enable access to clinical quality data, such as those from the Dansk Diabetes Database (DDiD) and the Dansk kvalitetsdatabase for diabetisk retinopati (DiaBase). Access depends on funding, data availability, and formal collaboration agreements. 


# Routine Registry Data

The routine registry data are also secondary data, however, they are only available on remote research servers. DD2 research data is uploaded to the servers hosted at Danmarks Statistik (DST, Statistics Denmark) and Sundhedsdatastyrelsen (SDS, The Danish Health Data Authority). On these servers, we have access to Danish medical and administrative registries, such as data from the CPR registry, hospital data from LPR, laboratory data from LAB-F etc. Linkage to additional registries and databases is possible with approval of data permission applications sent to Statistics Denmark or the Danish Health Data Authority.
