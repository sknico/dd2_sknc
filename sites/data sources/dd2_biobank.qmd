When patients are enrolled in the DD2, blood and a urine samples are collected and stored in the biobank in Vejle. The samples are from DD2 baseline, and future projects can have the samples analyzed if additional analyses are needed - the timing will always be baseline DD2.

Further information about the initial idea about the biobank: @Christensen_ClinEpi_2012.\
The documentation for the biobank can be downloaded here (Danish):{{\< downloadthis ../../files/biobank/DD2_dummy.pdf\

# Data sources

The data in the biobank are joined from multiple studies and data sets. The individual identifier in the biobank is `ProjektID` and it is unique per CPR number. The project ID should end with the digits -00 (individual). Another variable is `Barcode` which is similar to the project id, but it end with a number (e.g. -12, -19, or -99) and denotes the specific sample for the individual (see documentation above). Currently, the biomarker data includes ProjektID and individual-level biomarker results stored in wide format, but we are currently working on a new setup where data will be stored in long format.

Locally at KEA, the (original) data files are stored in the folder:\
O:\\HE_KEA-DATA-RAW0050\\Main Part\\data\\Input Data Sets\\BioBank

Data files from the 2022/2023 rounds are stored in the folder:\
O:\\HE\\KEA-DATA-RAW0050\\Biomarkører

## Original data

In the first phase of DD2, a lot of biomarkers were analysed for the first 1.053 individuals enrolled in DD2 (some have later opted out). These individuals are marked by the variable `BlodProve1053patients` (based on the CPR numbers in data files `First1053Patients` (same as in `UrinResultatermedRatio2013Nov`)) and are predominantly enrolled in 2011-2012.

These are the data files stored at KEA (files read in locally). File names might have changed since we initially received them.

-   `First1053Patients.txt`: We have probably received the data file in November 2012. It includes n=1.053 CPR numbers and they are most likely everyone in the database at that time. The file includes results from the initial blood samples. There are no dates in the data and there are no units for the variables hæmolyse, icteri, and lipæmi. The data set includes the variables:

    -   CPR
    -   ProjektID
    -   C-peptid (n=1.053, pmol/L)
    -   GAD (n=1.053, kU/l)
    -   Glucose (n=1.050, mmol/L)
    -   ALAT (n=1.030, U/L)
    -   Hæmolyse (n=1.030)
    -   Icteri (n=1.030)
    -   Lipæmi (n=1.030)
    -   AMYLP (n=1.041, U/L)
    -   CRP (n=1.041, mg/L)

We have been told (e-mail from JSN 31.05.2018) not to use the c-peptide measurements from this file (old analysis kit).

Information about some of the variables can be found in @Mor_DiabMetabResRev_2014.

-   `UrinResultatermedRatio2013Nov.txt`: We have probably received the data file in December 2013. It includes n=1.053 CPR numbers (same as in `First1053Patients`) with results from the initial urine samples. The data set includes the variables:

    -   CPR
    -   Barkode (ends with -19)
    -   ALBu_mg_L\_ (n=1.041, mg/L, dated November 19, 20, and 23, 2012)
    -   KREA_mmol_L\_ (n=1.041, mmol/L, dated November 19, 20, and 23, 2012)
    -   UPROT_g\_L\_ (n=1.041, g/L, dated November 19, 20, and 23, 2012)
    -   Albumin_Kreatinin_ratio (n=1.041)
    -   Kommentar (n=473, \<5 with "*PROT-U \> 2.5 g/l*" and the rest with "*ALB-U \<3 mg/L*")

-   `DataTilDD2medFastende.txt`: We have probably received the file in September 2015 (Anne Gedebjerg). It includes n=5.996 CPR numbers with character results on GAD, glucose, and c-peptide, along with a variable about faste. The majority of the individuals in the file are enrolled before 2015, but it only includes around 80-85% of the individuals enrolled before 2016. There are no dates in the data. The data set includes the variables:

    -   Id (ProjectID, ends with -00)
    -   GAD (numeric values for n=131 ID numbers, the value "*\<0,000*" for n=5.797 ID numbers, "*\>525,000*" for n=51 ID numbers, and "*?????*" or "*NA*" for the remaining n=20 ID numbers)
    -   Glucose (numeric values for n=4.457 and "*NA*" for the remaining n=1.539 ID numbers)
    -   Cpeptid (numeric values for n=5.964 and "*NA*" for the remaining n=32 ID numbers)
    -   Fastende ("*Ja*" for n=2.891, "*Nej*" for n=397, and "*Ved ikke*" for the remaining n=2.708 ID numbers) (see below for more infomation about fasting blood samples)

The majority of the initial 1.053 individuals are also included in this data file. We have been told to use the c-peptide measurements in this data file but to keep the CRP measurements from the original file and this file separated. The unit for CRP is mg/L in both data files.

-   `WrongCPeptideMeasurements.txt`: We have probably received the file in November 2015. It includes n=105 ID numbers (end with -00) and the variables cpeptid and NyCpeptid. The values are quite different. We have noted in the syntax that JSN has told us not to use these variables (e-mail 31.05.2018).

## Results from Anne Gedebjerg

-   `DD2 resultater.xlsx` (and `DD2 resultater_10_0095`, which is the version where \<10 is replaced by 10 and \<0,095 by 0,095): We have received the file in September 2017 (from Anne Gedebjerg). It includes n=7.519 barcodes (end with -99) in sheets of 100 or 101 rows, and should include CRP and mannose-binding lectin (MBL) on everyone enrolled by December 2016. See @Gedebjerg_DiabCare_2023 for more information. The data set includes the variables:

    -   barkode (ends with -99)
    -   CRP (n=7.510, mg/L)
    -   MBL (n=7.514, µg/L)

-   `Resultater den 250917 Anne Gedebjerg.xlsx`: We have received the file in September 2017 (from Anne Gedebjerg). It includes n=3.116 barcodes (end with -99) and variables regarding MBL expression genotyping (six SNPs in the MBL2 gene). The genotyping was done for the first \~3.000 individuals enrolled in DD2. See @Gedebjerg_DiabCare_2020 for more information. The data set includes the variables:

    -   barkode (ends with -99)
    -   HL
    -   XY
    -   PQ
    -   52
    -   54
    -   57
    -   HAPLOTYPE

<!-- ## New data -->

## April 2022 data

During 2022-2023 we received additional data on CRP, c-peptide, and glucose. We had a file with CRP in October 2022, but it is fully included in a file from January 2023 which also includes c-peptide and glucose. The October file is therefore not used during uploads, whereas the January 2023 file has been uploaded to the servers.

-   `DD2_cRP_Glucose_Cpep_2022_resultater (1).xlsx`: The data file includes n=3.399 projekt_id. They are all enrolled after the first n=1.053 individuals, but we don't know why they were analysed (not all individuals per year). The data set includes the variables: projekt_id, Cpeptid_Barkode, Cpeptid_Resultat, Cpeptid_Måleenhed, Cpeptid_Antal_decimaler, Cpeptid_Dato, Cpeptid_Notat, CRPHS_Barkode, CRPHS_Resultat, CRPHS_Måleenhed, CRPHS_Antal_decimaler, CRPHS_Dato, CRPHS_Notat, Glukose_Barkode, Glukose_Resultat, Glukose_Måleenhed, Glukose_Antal_decimaler, Glukose_Dato, Glukose_Notat.

    -   projekt_id (n=3.339)
    -   c-peptid (n=2.933, pmol/l, dated 30APR2022 or 01MAY2022)
    -   CRP (n=2.478, mg/l, dated 30APR2022 or 01MAY2022)
    -   Glucose (n=3.055, mmol/L, dated 02APR2022 or 03APR2022)

## C-peptide and glucose (full) (ikke lagt op endnu)

During the summer 2023 we have received data on c-peptide (July 2023) and glucose (August 2023). These files include **all** measurements from the biobank, and results from these files will thus replace all the other measurements from earlier data sets. We now have the files:

-   `dd2_all_C_peptide_14July2023.xls`: Includes n=9.762 project_id with data on c-peptide. The file also includes information about analysis date, sampling date, freezing date, unit, and kit. The following data management has been done by DD2 (e-mail from Sidsel, 14JUL2023) before we received the file: \
    *"- Jeg har erstattet alle 1254 observationer, som havde"gamle" målinger (før 28. feb 2015) med opdaterede målinger med nyt kit/assay (efter 28. feb 2015). \
    - Jeg har slettet 6 observationer, som kun havde en "gammel" måling og INGEN opdateret genmåling\
    - Jeg har renset op i data, så hvert individ kun fremgår med én måling, som er analyseret vha. nyt kit/assay "*

-   `DD2_glukoser_2023_08_23.xlsx`: The data file includes n=9.563 projekt_id and information about glucose, units, and dates.

### HOMA

[HOMA](https://www.rdm.ox.ac.uk/about/our-clinical-facilities-and-mrc-units/DTU/software/homa/history) values are calculated based on c-peptide and glucose. We use the Oxford calculator which can be downloaded from the website: <https://www.dtu.ox.ac.uk/homacalculator/download.php>.

HOMA values in the data are calcualted based on the c-peptide and glucose measurements received during the summer 2023.

## "Pladebiomarkører"

During 2022-2023, we have received new data from additional biomarker analyses (Allan Vaag grant). The majority of the new biomarkers are so-called "pladebiomarkører" (as opposed to the current ones which are called "målebiomarkører") because of the way the analyses are performed. In practice, everyone enrolled as of the day the blood samples were taken from the biobank (in the beginning of 2022) were included in the analysis (approx. the first 9.200 individuals). Data in these files are in long format and include the following 22 biomarkers (all with unit pg/ml) and the dates refer to when we received the data files:

-   TNF-a (April 2022, n=9.202, pg/ml)
-   IL-6 (April 2022, n=9.195, pg/ml)
-   Ang-Like4 (November 2022, n=9.200, pg/ml)
-   FGF-21 (November 2022, n=9.200, pg/ml)

-   CD163 (April 2023, n=9.047, pg/ml)
-   Galectin-3 (April 2023, n=9.008, pg/ml)
-   GDF-15 (April 2023, n=9.046, pg/ml)
-   NT-proBNP (April 2023, n=9.048, pg/ml)
-   Resistin (April 2023, n=9.046, pg/ml)
-   Serpin (April 2023, n=9.047, pg/ml)
-   YKL-40 (April 2023, n=9.045, pg/ml)
-   Osteopontin (June 2023, n=9.204, pg/ml) - ikke lagt op på serverne endnu

# Fasting

Is the patient fasting? A simple question, yet, difficult to assess.

Data from the DD2 questionnaire itself includes the variable `Er_patienten_fastende_` (whether the patient is fasting). Currently, around 75% of the individuals have answered that they are fasting. This variable can be used on its own, but should probably be combined with the variable `Tages_der_blodproeve_i_forbindel` (whether the blood sample was taken at the same time as the questionnaire was answered). If the fasting patients are restricted to include only those whose blood sample was taken at the same time as the questionnaire was answered, then around 72% of the individuals are defined to be fasting.

The data file `DataTilDD2medFastende.txt` received in September 2015 included information on fasting state for n=5.996 individuals ("*Ja*" for n=2.891, "*Nej*" for n=397, and "*Ved ikke*" for n=2.708 individuals). This file will not be updated and we therefore don't get new information on this fasting variable. We don't know how this variable was defined, but it is probably based on information on the blood sample itself. By adding the information from this file (variable name `NewFastende`) to the variable `Er_patienten_fastende_`, an additional 447 individuals can be defined as fasting (410 with missing information in `Er_patienten_fastende_` and 37 who replied not to be fasting in `Er_patienten_fastende_`).

Currently, the fasting state has been defined by the following (SAS) algorithm combining all the files and stating that the patient is fasting if we have any indication that this could be the case (macro: `AdditionalVars_Faste`):

```{r, eval = FALSE}

	if Tages_der_blodproeve_i_forbindel in: ('Ja') then do;
		if Er_patienten_fastende_=:'Ja' or NewFastende=:'Ja' then Faste='Ja';
		else if Er_patienten_fastende_=:'Nej' or NewFastende=:'Nej' then Faste='Nej';
	end;
	else if Tages_der_blodproeve_i_forbindel in: ('Nej') then do;
		if NewFastende=:'Ja' then Faste='Ja';
		else if NewFastende=:'Nej' then Faste='Nej';
	end;
	else if Tages_der_blodproeve_i_forbindel in (' ') then do;
		if Er_patienten_fastende_=:'Ja' or NewFastende=:'Ja' then Faste='Ja';
		else if  Er_patienten_fastende_=:'Nej' or NewFastende=:'Nej' then Faste='Nej'; 
	end;


```


::: callout-info
The plan is that DD2 will make an "official" definition of Faste and a variable indicating the fasting state will thus be included in the original data.
