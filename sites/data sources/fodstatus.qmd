The DD2 cohort is linked to the Podiatrist Database (fodstatusdatabasen). This database was established in 2011, and includes information on examinations performed by Danish podiatrists working under a collective agreement with the Danish Administrative Regions (@Kristensen_ClinEpi_2024). Records include symptoms of neuropathy and information from a clinical examination of the lower extremities (including circulatory and neuropathy status).

Individuals in DD2 enrolled between 2011 and 2022 are linked to the Podiatrist Database. Approximately 60% of the DD2 participants have at least one record in the database, and they have median 4 (IQR 2-6) records. DD2 participants without records may have had foot examinations by other healthcare professionals (e.g., diabetes outpatient clinics, general practitioners), a private podiatrist not working under the collective agreement or may not have been examined at all (@Kristensen_ClinEpi_2024).
