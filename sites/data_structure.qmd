The full DD2 research data is based on data collected/linked from multiple sources. This page is intended to give an overview of the data structure, the data sources, and the definitions of data types. Detailed description of each of the data sources can be found on the following pages.

The data sources include **primary data**, i.e., data that exists only within DD2, including data/information collected from participants at enrollment, and additional primary data derived from nested research studies in the DD2 cohort. The data also include **secondary data**, i.e., external data collected from other data sources and then linked to DD2. In addition, DD2 data (primary and secondary data) is linked to the nationwide routine registry data located in centralized databases (SDS and DST).

# Primary data

Primary data can be split into two sections

1.  DD2 enrollment information

2.  Additional DD2 data derived from research studies.

## 1. DD2 enrollment information

DD2 enrollment information include the information that make the foundation of DD2, i.e.,

-   DD2 interview data

-   Data from clinical examination at enrollment

-   Blood and urine samples collected for storage in the DD2 biobank in Vejle.

To be enrolled in DD2, the individual fills out the DD2 questionnaire and a blood/urine sample is collected. The DD2 cohort itself is defined to be those who enrolled in the DD2 (by answering the DD2 questionnaire), and the DD2 enrollment information only exist within DD2, i.e., the interview data and data from the clinical examination is only available though DD2. All blood and urine samples are stored in the DD2 biobank and are available for researchers. The samples have not necessarily been analyzed, as analysis of samples generally depends on funding provided through specific research studies.

## 2. Additional DD2 data

Research studies nested within the DD2 cohort have the potential to generate new primary data. The completeness and availability of these data depend on the time points at which the research studies generated the results. The additional DD2 data are data generated only among individuals in DD2 (only available through DD2), but it was (probably) not collected as part of the initial enrollment process. This could e.g., be data from studies collecting additional follow-up DD2 data (by a follow-up questionnaire or follow-up clinical examinations) or from intervention studies using the DD2 cohort. As the physical blood/urine samples are collected at enrollment (and therefore in the DD2 enrollment data category) and currently stored in a biobank, it holds potential for additional biomarker analyses, genetic analyses, DNA sequencing etc., which would add to the primary collected data by adding additional baseline information.

Examples of additional DD2 could include

-   IDNC questionnaire data, a follow-up questionnaire from 2016 including (follow-up) questions from the initial questionnaire along with multiple questions concerning diabetic neuropathy.

-   IDA, DICTA, CsubT2D, etc., are examples of projects initiated within DD2. These projects generate their own additional data and analyses but data are still part of the overall DD2 setup.

These data sources will not be routinely updated with new individuals or additional data, as they are mostly generated as part of specific research projects with closed cohorts. The data can be accessed through collaboration with DD2 research groups.

# Secondary data

Secondary data include data from external data sources that were not initially generated with the intention to be included in DD2. However, as data can be considered relevant for DD2 research questions, we have linked data from these external data sources to the DD2. In practice, this means that data (or a subset of data) has been handed over from the external data source to DD2, and we thus have relevant data on (a subset of) the individuals in DD2. Linkage to external data sources is considered a crucial source of data in DD2, as it allows for information about variables that are resource-intensive to collect in clinical practice and unavailable in the Danish health registries. The secondary DD2 data are data accessed from non-centralized data source, and we currently have agreements with the following external data sources:

-   The Danish Diabetes Database for Adults (DDDA) (closed by June 2022)

-   DDiD (new version of DDDA)

-   The Danish National Podiatrist Registry (fodstatusdatabasen)

-   Diabase (øjenkomplikationer, vi har p.t. ingen aftale, men vi arbejder på det)

-   The Danish National Archive (Rigsarkivet), currently including birth data from midwife journals.

The general idea is that we can get updates of data from these data sources, either by e.g., including more follow-up time or by including more individuals. For some of these data sources we will therefor have the most recent data on all the current individuals in DD2, and we can also get updated data whenever we have new individuals in the DD2 cohort. The secondary data can be accessed through collaboration with DD2 research groups.

# Routine Registry Data

The routine registry data is also secondary data, however, it is only available on remote research servers. DD2 research data will be uploaded to the servers hosted at Danmarks Statistik (DST, Statistics Denmark) and Sundhedsdatastyrelsen (SDS, The Danish Health Data Authority). On these servers, we have access to Danish medical and administrative registries, such as data from the CPR registry, hospital data from LPR, laboratory data from LAB-F etc. Linkage to additional registries and databases is possible with approval of data permission applications sent to Statistics Denmark or the Danish Health Data Authority.
