The intention of this website is to document the data sources used for research and to support the day-to-day work with DD2. It is mainly aimed at employees of the Department of Clinical Epidemiology (DCE), Aarhus University and Aarhus University Hospital, as it describes the setup used at DCE. Other institutions can also access DD2 data but their setup might differ.\nTo learn more about DD2, please visit the official DD2 website: https://dd2.dk/\nPlease see Nielsen et al.

Individuals with a non-valid CPR number are still included in the uploaded data, e.g. in DS_EXT_DD2CORE, but they will have a missing encrypted CPR number (CPR_ENCRYPTED) and can thus not be linked across data sources. When we had local registry data, we would notify DD2 about non-valid CPR numbers, but this is no longer possible as we are not allowed to identify the individuals based on individual-level data on the servers.\nThe data files uploaded by us have the prefix DS_EXT_. Data are available in 2 versions; the initial upload version (without suffix) and the updated versions (with suffix _230601, _231026, etc., corresponding to the date of the update on SDS).

    "text": "Enrollment in DD2 involves filling out a questionnaire and providing urine and blood samples. All Danish residents older than 18 years of age diagnosed with diabetes within the last 2 years are eligible for inclusion in DD2 (previously, a longer diabetes duration was allowed). Individuals may either sign up online and be contacted later, or be approached by practice personnel during routine care. The individual will receive an e-mail with a link to WebPatient, where a few questions should be filled out before the questionnaire will be sent to the practice. Hereafter, a DD2 examination will take place, where additional questions will be answered (e.g., a clinically assessed date of diabetes onset) along with a physical examination (e.g., to measure weight, hip and waist circumference, and resting heart rate). The examination also involves a urine sample (morning urine) and a blood sample (fasting).\nEnrollment can either take place in the general practice or in the outpatient clinic. For further information about the enrollment, please see the official DD2 website (Danish): Patient information and Instructions and questionnaires.\n\n\n\n\nFigure from https://dd2.dk/om-dd2/hvem-er-med (downloaded 30 October 2025) showing the general practitioners and outpatient clinic enrolling individuals in DD2.\n\n\n\nThe first individual was enrolled in DD2 in November 2010.

These individuals are marked by the variable BlodProve1053patients (based on the CPR numbers in data files First1053Patients and UrinResultatermedRatio2013Nov) and are predominantly enrolled in 2011-2012.\n\nFirst1053Patients.txt: The file appears to have been received in November 2012. It includes N=1,053 CPR numbers and these individuals are most likely everyone in the database at that time. The file includes results from the initial blood samples. The dataset lacks date information and also unit specifications for the variables hæmolyse, icteri, and lipæmi. The dataset includes the variables:\n\nCPR\nProjektID\nC-peptid (N=1,053, pmol/L)\nGAD (N=1,053, kU/L)\nGlucose (N=1,050, mmol/L)\nALAT (N=1,030, U/L)\nHæmolyse (N=1,030)\nIcteri (N=1,030)\nLipæmi (N=1,030)\nAMYLP (N=1,041, U/L)\nCRP (N=1,041, mg/L)\n\n\nIt is recommended not to use c-peptide measurements from this file, since the samples are analysed using an old type of analysis kit (see below).        \nInformation about some of the variables can be found in Mor et al. (2014).\n\nUrinResultatermedRatio2013Nov.txt: DCE likely received the data file in December 2013.

Since summer 2024, access to the HOMA calculator requires a licence (should be free of charge for “academic researchers”).\nHOMA values in the data are calculated based on the c-peptide and glucose measurements received during the summer 2023. HOMA has only been estimated for glucose values in the interval 3.0-25 and c-peptide 0.2-3.5 (because of an updated Oxford HOMA calculator where values out of range cause problems in the excel calculator). Some individuals might therefore have glucose and c-peptide values but no HOMA values in the new data. HOMA values are estimated regardless og fasting status.",

For example, the SNP named 1:202940589:G:A_A in the original data file, is denoted _1_202940589_G_A_A in the uploaded data.

The completeness and availability of these primary data depend on when the studies are conducted and when results become available. The data are generated among individuals already enrolled in DD2, and are likely not collected during the initial enrollment process. This could e.g., be data from studies collecting additional follow-up data (by a follow-up questionnaire or follow-up clinical examinations) or from intervention studies including individuals from the DD2 cohort.\nThe biological samples (blood and urine) are collected at enrollment and thus considered enrollment material. However, they are stored in the biobank, and can be used for additional analyses in new research studies, e.g., biomarker analyses, genetic studies, or DNA sequencing. These analysis results add to the primary collected data by adding additional baseline information.\nExamples of currently available additional DD2 data include: \n\nIDNC questionnaire data. This is a follow-up questionnaire from 2016 including (follow-up) questions from the initial questionnaire along with multiple questions concerning diabetic neuropathy.\nIDA, DICTA, CsubT2D (registry, genetics, biomarker ), etc., are examples of subprojects initiated by DD2 research groups. These research groups generate their own additional data, but the data are still part of the overall DD2 setup. \nQoL data. After enrollment, an e-mail with a questionnaire about quality of life (QoL) is sent to the individual. Additional follow-up questionnaires are sent after 2 years, 4 years, and 6 years.\n\nThese data sources will most likely not be routinely updated with new individuals or additional information, as they are primarily generated as part of specific research projects with closed cohorts. The data can be accessed through collaboration with DD2 research groups.",
