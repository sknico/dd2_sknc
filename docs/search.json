The intention with this website is to document the data sources used for research and to ease the day-to-day work with DD2. It is mainly aimed at employees at Department of Clinical Epidemiology (DCE/KEA), Aarhus University and Aarhus University Hospital, as it is describing the setup used at DCE. Other institutions can also access DD2 data but their setup might be different.\nTo learn more about DD2 please see: https://dd2.dk/\nPlease see the 2012 paper about the DD2 enrollment process, Nielsen et al. (2012), and the 2018 baseline paper Christensen et al. (2018) with information about enrollment, data sources, and baseline characteristics. An updated version of this paper has recently been published, Kristensen et al. (2024). An extensive list of scientific publications based on data from DD2 is available on the official website.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nChristensen DH, Nicolaisen SK, Berencsi K, Beck-Nielsen H, Rungby J, Friborg S, et al.

In November 2024, we had to make a “genindtilling” via DDV and in principle make a new data agreement. We used this opportunity to make some changes in the data structure (e.g., from IL6_TNF to BIOMARK and GENETIK)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShort description\nDetailed description\nDate\nAffected data sets\n\n\n\n\nOriginal upload\nUpload of data sets for the initial server access. Data from the original upload are located in the folder with “Eksterne data” under the rawdata folder (Rawdata &gt; 708637 &gt; Eksterne data). DD2 data are in the 20230104_FraSDS folder, whereas SDS data are in the folder 20221020_FraSDS.

IL6_TNF was updated with all 22 “pladebiomarkører” and renamed to BIOMARK. The data set GENETIK was also included. The data set INFODATA including e.g., DICTA was also included.\nNovember 2024/March 2025 (upload available in the folders 20250402_FraSDS and 03032025). We are still waiting for registry updates (mainly due to changes at SDS)\nDD2CORE, BIOBANK, DDDA, FOEDSELSDATA, IDNC, FODSTATUS, BIOMARK, GENETIK, INFODATA.\n\n\n\nNB: we try to distinguish between “update” and “upload”. An “update” means that the population, and therefore also the registry data, has changed, and that the entire DD2 cohort should be seen as a new version. By “upload” we mean additional data uploaded to the current population. This could for example be adding analyses from the biobank or adding a new data source, i.e., something that doesn’t affect the population itself. The plan is to make one annual update (November/end of the year) and two to three additional uploads during per year.\nRegistry data on the forskermaskine is updated regularly. LPR-data for the previous calendar year (e.g. 2023) is available during October/November (2024), i.e., if we prepare for a new population update at the end of the year (2024), we will probably be able to get LPR-data for the full previous calendar year (2023), when we receive data in the beginning of the next year (2025). Other registries are updated at different time points (e.g., LMDB is updated quarterly).",

    "text": "Enrollment in DD2 involves a questionnaire and the collection of urine and blood samples. The questionnaire includes a section with a few questions for the patient to fill out (at registration for enrollement) and another to be filled out by the enroller (at enrollement). All individuals older than 18 years of age diagnosed with diabetes within the last 2 years are eligible for inclusion in DD2 (previously, a longer diabetes duration was allowed).\nThe individual can either sign up online (and then be contacted) or be approached by the practice personnel (e.g., during a regular diabetes check-up). The individual will receive an e-mail with a link to WebPatient, where a few questions should be filled out before the questionnaire will be sent to the practice. Hereafter, a DD2 examination will take place, where additional questions will be answered (e.g., a clinically assessed diabetes debut date) along with a physical examination (e.g., to measure weight, hip and waist circumference, and resting heart rate). The examination also involves a urine sample (morning urine) and a blood sample (fasting).\nEnrollment can either take place in the practice/GP or in the outpatient clinic. Registration is also possible for individuals without internet access. For further information about the enrollment, please see the DD2 website (Danish): Patient information and Instructions and questionnaires.\nSome of the general documents can also be downloaded here (Danish, downloaded 12 January 2024):\n\nDD2 questionnaire:  Download \nInclusion information:  Download \nBiobank samples:  Download  and  Download \n\nFor more information about the enrollment and data collection, please contact DD2.",

A total of 5,755 questionnaires were returned during the fall of 2016 and the inclusion ended in January 2017 (24 January 2017). The questionnaire included questions about height, weight, smoking and alcohol, and physical activity. These questions were intended to be follow-up questions similar to those from the baseline questionnaire. In addition, the questionnaire included questions about falls, quality of life, sleep, mental health, neuropathy (in hand and feet) and pain.

The completeness and availability of these data depend on the time points at which the research studies generated the results. The additional DD2 data are data generated only among individuals in DD2 (only available through DD2), but it was (probably) not collected as part of the initial enrollment process. This could e.g., be data from studies collecting additional follow-up DD2 data (by a follow-up questionnaire or follow-up clinical examinations) or from intervention studies using the DD2 cohort. As the physical blood/urine samples are collected at enrollment (and therefore in the DD2 enrollment data category) and currently stored in a biobank, it holds potential for additional biomarker analyses, genetic analyses, DNA sequencing etc., which would add to the primary collected data by adding additional baseline information.\nExamples of additional DD2 could include\n\nIDNC questionnaire data, a follow-up questionnaire from 2016 including (follow-up) questions from the initial questionnaire along with multiple questions concerning diabetic neuropathy.\nIDA, DICTA, CsubT2D, etc., are examples of projects initiated within DD2. These projects generate their own additional data and analyses but data are still part of the overall DD2 setup.\n\nThese data sources will not be routinely updated with new individuals or additional data, as they are mostly generated as part of specific research projects with closed cohorts. The data can be accessed through collaboration with DD2 research groups.",

The data set DS_EXT_DD2_POP includes all individuals with a valid CPR-number. Individuals with a non-valid CPR-number are still included in the uploaded data, e.g. in DS_EXT_DD2CORE, but they will have a missing encrypted CPR-number (CPR_ENCRYPTED) and can thus not be linked across data sources. Previously (when we had local data), we would notify DD2 (Odense) about non-valid CPR-numbers, but this is no longer possible as we are not allowed to identify the individuals based on individual-level data on the servers.\nThe data files uploaded by us have the prefix DS_EXT_. Data are available in 2 versions; the initial upload version (without suffix) and the updated versions (with suffix _230601, _231026, etc., corresponding to the date of the update on SDS). The registry data (views) will always be based on the newest population, i.e., individuals in the newest version of DS_EXT_DD2_POP.",

An “update” means that the population, and therefore also the registry data, has changed, and that the entire DD2 cohort should be seen as a new version. By “upload” we mean additional data uploaded to the current population. This could for example be adding analyses from the biobank or adding a new data source, i.e., something that doesn’t affect the population itself. The plan is to make one annual update (November/end of the year) and two to three additional uploads during per year.",
