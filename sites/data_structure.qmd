The full DD2 research data are based on data collected and linked from multiple sources (@Kristensen_ClinEpi_2024). This page gives an overview of the data structure, the data sources, and the definitions of data types. Detailed descriptions of each data source are provided on the following pages.

Within the DD2 data collection, the data sources include **primary data**, i.e., data unique to DD2, including data and material collected from participants at enrollment, and additional data from research studies within the DD2 cohort. The data also include **secondary data**, i.e., external data collected from other data sources and then linked to DD2. Data from the DD2 data collection are also linked to the nationwide routine registry data located in centralized databases on remote research servers.

# Primary data

Primary data can be split into two categories:

## 1. DD2 enrollment material
Everything collected during the DD2 enrollment constitutes the DD2 enrollment material and forms the foundation of DD2 as a distinct data source. This includes:

-   DD2 interview data (questionnaire)

-   Data from the clinical examination at enrollment

-   Blood and urine samples collected for storage in the DD2 biobank in Vejle.

Enrollment in DD2 involves completing the DD2 questionnaire, undergoing the clinical examination, and providing blood and urine samples. The DD2 cohort is defined by individuals who completed the enrollment process. These materials are unique to DD2 and are not available from other sources. All blood and urine samples are stored in the DD2 biobank and may be used for future research, though analyses of the samples typically depend on funding from specific studies.


## 2. Additional DD2 data

Research studies in the DD2 setup can generate new primary data. The completeness and availability of these primary data depend on when the studies are conducted and when results become available. The data are generated among individuals already enrolled in DD2, and are likely not collected during the initial enrollment process. This could e.g., be data from studies collecting additional follow-up data (by a follow-up questionnaire or follow-up clinical examinations) or from intervention studies including individuals from the DD2 cohort.      
The biological samples (blood and urine) are collected at enrollment and thus considered enrollment material. However, they are stored in the biobank, and can be used for additional analyses in new research studies, e.g., biomarker analyses, genetic studies, or DNA sequencing. These analysis results add to the primary collected data by adding additional baseline information.

Examples of currently available additional DD2 data include:

-   [IDNC](/sites/data sources/dd2_idnc.qmd) questionnaire data. This is a follow-up questionnaire from 2016 including (follow-up) questions from the initial questionnaire along with multiple questions concerning diabetic neuropathy.

), etc., are examples of subprojects initiated by DD2 research groups. These research groups generate their own additional data, but the data are still part of the overall DD2 setup.

-   QoL data. After enrollment, an e-mail with a questionnaire about quality of life is sent to the individual. Additional follow-up questionnaires are sent after 2 years, 4 years, and 6 years. 

These data sources will most likely not be routinely updated with new individuals or additional information, as they are primarily generated as part of specific research projects with closed cohorts. The data can be accessed through collaboration with DD2 research groups.

# Secondary data

Secondary data refer to data from external but non-centralized data sources. They were not initially generated with the intention to be included in DD2. However, as they may be relevant to DD2 research questions, data from these external data sources are linked to the DD2. In practice, this means that data (or a subset of data) are transferred from the external data source to DD2, providing information on the individuals (or a subset of individuals) in DD2. Linkage to external data sources is crucial in DD2, as it allows for information about variables that are resource-intensive to collect in clinical practice and unavailable in the Danish health registries. DD2 currently have data from the following external data sources:

<!-- abbreviation ignoreres ved bullets  -->
-   The Danish Diabetes Database for Adults (DDDA, closed by June 2022)

-   The Danish National Podiatrist Registry (fodstatusdatabasen)

-   The Danish National Archive (Rigsarkivet), currently including birth data from midwife journals.

In general, updates from these sources may be possible, for example by extending follow-up periods or including additional individuals. The secondary data can be accessed through collaboration with DD2 research groups. Additional agreements may be established with RKKP to enable access to clinical quality data, such as those from the DDiD and the DiaBase. Access depends on funding, data availability, and formal collaboration agreements. 


# Routine Registry Data

The routine registry data are also secondary data, however, they are only available on remote research servers and not considered part of the DD2 data collection. DD2 research data is uploaded to the servers hosted at DST and SDS. On these servers, access is provided to Danish medical and administrative registries, such as data from the CPR registry, hospital data from the DNPR, prescription data, laboratory data etc. Linkage to additional registries and databases is possible after approval of data permission applications sent to DST or SDS.
