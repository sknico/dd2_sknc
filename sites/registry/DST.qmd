## Danmarks Statistik (DST)/Statistics Denmark

DST Projektnr. 708637 and transfer agreement FSEID-00006159 at SDS. <br>
Locally at DCE, data are stored here: <br>
O:\\HE_KEA-DATA-RAW0050\\Forskermaskiner\\DST - projektnr 708637 (SDS FSEID-00006159) <br>
"Udtræksbeskrivelser" can be downloaded from DDV. 


The project is placed under the "Projektdatabaseordning (705004)". The DD2 projects itself has the project number 708637 (via 705004), and the agreement with DST makes registry data available. Data from Det Psykiatriske Centrale Forskningsregister, Laboratoriedatabasens Forskertabel, Overvågningsdata - COVID-19-testsvar fra SSI, Det Danske Vaccinationsregister - COVID-19-vaccinationsdata fra SSI, and Cancerregisteret are tranferred from SDS (FSEID-00006159). Data from Lægemiddelstatistikregisteret are included via DDV, but based on the agreement with SDS (FSEID-00006159).



## Population

The DD2 data are uploaded to DST, and the population include all individuals in `DD2CORE` (encrypted CPR). Linked registry data and based on the individuals in the dataset `pniveau`.
Registry data are available in the DST folders (and subfolders): <br> 
E:\\ProjektDB\\KEA\\Rawdata\\708637\\Grunddata <br>
E:\\ProjektDB\\KEA\\Rawdata\\708637\\Eksterne data <br>


### Formats

On DST, formats from DST and IDNC should be included manually. Here is an example of how it can be done in SAS

```{r, eval = FALSE}
libname fmt "E:\Formater\SAS formater i DAnmarks Statistik\FORMATKATALOG" access=readonly;
options fmtsearch=(fmt.disced fmt.times_personstatistik fmt.dream fmt.statistikbank);

libname idnc "E:\ProjektDB\KEA\Workdata\708637\Common\IDNC formats" access=readonly;
options fmtsearch=(idnc.idnc_formats);
```

## Data uploads

The first data were uploaded in 2022 when the server access was initially established. Since then, DST has changed their system to DDV. In November 2024, a "genindstilling" was made via DDV and it was in principle a new data agreement. We used this opportunity to make some changes in the data structure (e.g., from IL6_TNF to BIOMARK and GENETIK)

| Short description | Detailed description | Date | Affected datasets |
|------------------|------------------|:-----------------|-----------------:|
| Original upload | Upload of datasets for the initial server access. Data from the original upload are located in the folder with "Eksterne data" under the rawdata folder (Rawdata \> 708637 \> Eksterne data). DD2 data are in the 20230104_FraSDS folder, whereas SDS data are in the folder 20221020_FraSDS. Registry data are in the Grunddata folder | Summer 2022 | DD2CORE, DD2_POP, BIOBANK, DDDA, FOEDSELSDATA, IDNC, IL6_TNF |
| General update (DDV) | Population update (November 2023), updated biobank data (variables from April 2022), including the new data source FODSTATUS, and a general update of registry data. IL6_TNF was updated with all 22 "pladebiomarkører" and renamed to BIOMARK. The dataset GENETIK was also included. The dataset INFODATA including e.g., DICTA was also included. | November 2024/March 2025 (upload available in the folders 20250402_FraSDS and 03032025). We are still waiting for registry updates (mainly due to changes at SDS) | DD2CORE, BIOBANK, DDDA, FOEDSELSDATA, IDNC, FODSTATUS, BIOMARK, GENETIK, INFODATA. |
| Registry update | Updated data from DST and SDS ("omlægning") | November 2025 | Updated registry data |



<!-- Registry data on the forskermaskine is updated regularly. LPR-data for the previous calendar year (e.g. 2023) is available during October/November (2024), i.e., if we prepare for a new population update at the end of the year (2024), we will probably be able to get LPR-data for the full previous calendar year (2023), when we receive data in the beginning of the next year (2025). Other registries are updated at different time points (e.g., LMDB is updated quarterly). -->
