This website includes details about **The Danish Center for Strategic Research in Type 2 Diabetes** (The **DD2** Study). The intention with this website is to document the data sources used for research and to ease the day-to-day work with DD2. It is mainly aimed at employees at Department of Clinical Epidemiology (DCE/KEA), Aarhus University and Aarhus University Hospital, as it is describing the setup used at DCE. Other institutions can also gain access to DD2 data but their setup might be different.

To learn more about DD2 please see: <https://dd2.dk/>

Please see the 2012 paper about the DD2 enrollment process, @Nielsen_ClinEpi_2012, and the 2018 baseline paper @Christensen_BMJOpen_2018 with information about enrollment, data sources, and baseline characteristics. An updated version of this paper has recently been published, @Kristensen_ClinEpi_2024. An extensive list of [scientific publications](https://dd2.dk/nyheder/categories/videnskabelige-publikationer) based on data from DD2 is available on the website.
