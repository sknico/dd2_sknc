In November 2024, we had to make a “genindtilling” via DDV and in principle make a new data agreement. We used this opportunity to make some changes in the data structure (e.g., from IL6_TNF to BIOMARK and GENETIK)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShort description\nDetailed description\nDate\nAffected datasets\n\n\n\n\nOriginal upload\nUpload of datasets for the initial server access.

DD2 data are in the 20230104_FraSDS folder, whereas SDS data are in the folder 20221020_FraSDS. Registry data are in the Grunddata folder\nSummer 2022\nDD2CORE, DD2_POP, BIOBANK, DDDA, FOEDSELSDATA, IDNC, IL6_TNF\n\n\nGeneral update (DDV)\nPopulation update (November 2023), updated biobank data (variables from April 2022), including the new data source FODSTATUS, and a general update of registry data. IL6_TNF was updated with all 22 “pladebiomarkører” and renamed to BIOMARK. The dataset GENETIK was also included. The dataset INFODATA including e.g., DICTA was also included.\nNovember 2024/March 2025 (upload available in the folders 20250402_FraSDS and 03032025). We are still waiting for registry updates (mainly due to changes at SDS)\nDD2CORE, BIOBANK, DDDA, FOEDSELSDATA, IDNC, FODSTATUS, BIOMARK, GENETIK, INFODATA.\n\n\n\nNB: we try to distinguish between “update” and “upload”. An “update” means that the population, and therefore also the registry data, has changed, and that the entire DD2 cohort should be seen as a new version. By “upload” we mean additional data uploaded to the current population. This could for example be adding analyses from the biobank or adding a new data source, i.e., something that doesn’t affect the population itself.\nRegistry data on the forskermaskine is updated regularly. LPR-data for the previous calendar year (e.g. 2023) is available during October/November (2024), i.e., if we prepare for a new population update at the end of the year (2024), we will probably be able to get LPR-data for the full previous calendar year (2023), when we receive data in the beginning of the next year (2025). Other registries are updated at different time points (e.g., LMDB is updated quarterly).",

    "text": "2. Additional DD2 data\nResearch studies in the DD2 setup can generate new primary data. The completeness and availability of these primary data depend on when the studies are conducted and when results become available. The data are generated among individuals already enrolled in DD2, and are likely not collected during the initial enrollment process. This could e.g., be data from studies collecting additional follow-up data (by a follow-up questionnaire or follow-up clinical examinations) or from intervention studies including individuals from the DD2 cohort.\nThe biological samples (blood and urine) are collected at enrollment and thus considered enrollment material. However, they are stored in the biobank, and can be used for additional analyses in new research studies, e.g., biomarker analyses, genetic studies, or DNA sequencing. These analysis results add to the primary collected data by adding additional baseline information.\nExamples of currently available additional DD2 data include: \n\nIDNC questionnaire data. This is a follow-up questionnaire from 2016 including (follow-up) questions from the initial questionnaire along with multiple questions concerning diabetic neuropathy.\nIDA, DICTA, CsubT2D (registry, genetics, biomarker ), etc., are examples of subprojects initiated by DD2 research groups. These research groups generate their own additional data, but the data are still part of the overall DD2 setup. \nQoL data. After enrollment, an e-mail with a questionnaire about quality of life (QoL) is sent to the individual. Additional follow-up questionnaires are sent after 2 years, 4 years, and 6 years.\n\nThese data sources will most likely not be routinely updated with new individuals or additional information, as they are primarily generated as part of specific research projects with closed cohorts. The data can be accessed through collaboration with DD2 research groups.",

No automatic or standard analyses are conducted, but DD2 research projects can have the samples analyzed if (additional) analyses are needed. Irrespective of when the analyses are performed, the timing for the analysis results will always be baseline DD2, because that was the time the blood/urine sample was collected. The results from analyses of the blood and urine samples are considered “Additional DD2 data”.\nFor further information about the initial idea about the biobank, please see Christensen et al.

A list of 7,011 CPR numbers from all individuals enrolled in DD2 by February 2016 were sent to the CPR registry, where the CPR status was assessed as of 24 May 2016. A total of 6,726 questionnaires were sent out on 07 June 2016. A reminder was sent on 12 September 2016 and again on 10 October 2016 to those who had not provided a response. A total of 5,755 questionnaires were returned during the fall of 2016 and the inclusion ended on 24 January 2017. The questionnaire included questions about height, weight, smoking and alcohol, and physical activity. These questions were follow-up questions similar to those from the baseline questionnaire. In addition, the questionnaire included questions about falls, quality of life, sleep, mental health, neuropathy (in hand and feet) and pain. The questionnaire thus included the Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument questionnaire (MNSIq) and the Douleur Neuropathique en 4 (DN4) questions.\nRead more about the IDNC questionnaire study in Gylfadottir et al.

All Danish residents older than 18 years of age diagnosed with diabetes within the last 2 years are eligible for inclusion in DD2 (previously, a longer diabetes duration was allowed). Individuals may either sign up online and be contacted later, or be approached by practice personnel during routine care. The individual will receive an e-mail with a link to WebPatient, where a few questions should be filled out before the questionnaire will be sent to the practice. Hereafter, a DD2 examination will take place, where additional questions will be answered (e.g., a clinically assessed date of diabetes onset) along with a physical examination (e.g., to measure weight, hip and waist circumference, and resting heart rate). The examination also involves a urine sample (morning urine) and a blood sample (fasting).\nEnrollment can either take place in the general practice or in the outpatient clinic.

All new variables are labelled “Gen1”\nApril 2024 (_240429)\nIL6_TNF\n\n\nUpload of biobank data (genetics) and DICTA variable\nAdditional genetic variables were added to IL6_TNF. In DD2CORE the DICTA variable was added.\nJuly 2024 (_240711)\nDD2CORE, IL6_TNF\n\n\nPopulation update and upload of genetics\nThe population (and registries) was updated (November 2023) and additional genetic variables were included. We made the SDS update in the same round where the DST data were updated (genindstilling via DDV), and decided to rename IL6_TNF to BIOMARK including only the “pladebiomarkører”, and including the genetic variables in a separate dataset called GENETIK. The dataset INFODATA including e.g., DICTA was also included.\nDecember 2024 (upload not available as we are waiting for SDS updates)\nDD2CORE, DD2_POP, BIOMARK, GENETIK, INFODATA\n\n\nDecember 2024 upload\nThe upload from December 2024 was made available and we added CAR and DAR from the “omlægning af registre” (still waiting for LAB).\nJune 2025\nDD2CORE, DD2_POP, BIOMARK, GENETIK, INFODATA (and CAR+DAR from registries)\n\n\n\nNB: we try to distinguish between “update” and “upload”. An “update” means that the population, and therefore also the registry data, has changed, and that the entire DD2 cohort should be seen as a new version. By “upload” we mean additional data uploaded to the current population. This could for example be adding analyses from the biobank or adding a new data source, i.e., something that doesn’t affect the population itself.",
