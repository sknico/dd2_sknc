The intention of this website is to document the data sources used for research and to support the day-to-day work with DD2. It is mainly aimed at employees of the Department of Clinical Epidemiology (DCE/KEA), Aarhus University and Aarhus University Hospital, as it describes the setup used at DCE. Other institutions can also access DD2 data but their setup might differ.\nTo learn more about DD2 please see: https://dd2.dk/\nPlease see the 2012 paper about the DD2 enrollment process (Nielsen et al. (2012)) and the 2018 and 2024 cohort papers (Christensen et al. (2018) and Kristensen et al. (2024)) with information about enrollment, data sources, and baseline characteristics.

In November 2024, we had to make a “genindtilling” via DDV and in principle make a new data agreement. We used this opportunity to make some changes in the data structure (e.g., from IL6_TNF to BIOMARK and GENETIK)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShort description\nDetailed description\nDate\nAffected data sets\n\n\n\n\nOriginal upload\nUpload of data sets for the initial server access. Data from the original upload are located in the folder with “Eksterne data” under the rawdata folder (Rawdata &gt; 708637 &gt; Eksterne data).

Registry data are in the Grunddata folder\nSummer 2022\nDD2CORE, DD2_POP, BIOBANK, DDDA, FOEDSELSDATA, IDNC, IL6_TNF\n\n\nGeneral update (DDV)\nPopulation update (November 2023), updated biobank data (variables from April 2022), including the new data source FODSTATUS, and a general update of registry data. IL6_TNF was updated with all 22 “pladebiomarkører” and renamed to BIOMARK. The data set GENETIK was also included. The data set INFODATA including e.g., DICTA was also included.\nNovember 2024/March 2025 (upload available in the folders 20250402_FraSDS and 03032025). We are still waiting for registry updates (mainly due to changes at SDS)\nDD2CORE, BIOBANK, DDDA, FOEDSELSDATA, IDNC, FODSTATUS, BIOMARK, GENETIK, INFODATA.\n\n\n\nNB: we try to distinguish between “update” and “upload”. An “update” means that the population, and therefore also the registry data, has changed, and that the entire DD2 cohort should be seen as a new version. By “upload” we mean additional data uploaded to the current population. This could for example be adding analyses from the biobank or adding a new data source, i.e., something that doesn’t affect the population itself. The plan is to make one annual update (November/end of the year) and two to three additional uploads during per year.\nRegistry data on the forskermaskine is updated regularly. LPR-data for the previous calendar year (e.g. 2023) is available during October/November (2024), i.e., if we prepare for a new population update at the end of the year (2024), we will probably be able to get LPR-data for the full previous calendar year (2023), when we receive data in the beginning of the next year (2025). Other registries are updated at different time points (e.g., LMDB is updated quarterly).",

The completeness and availability of these primary data depend on when the studies are conducted and when results become available. The data are generated among individuals already enrolled in DD2, and are likely not collected during the initial enrollment process. This could e.g., be data from studies collecting additional follow-up data (by a follow-up questionnaire or follow-up clinical examinations) or from intervention studies including individuals from the DD2 cohort.\nThe biological samples (blood and urine) are collected at enrollment and thus considered enrollment material. However, they are stored in the biobank, and can be used for additional analyses in new research studies, e.g., biomarker analyses, genetic studies, or DNA sequencing. These analysis results add to the primary collected data by adding additional baseline information.\nExamples of currently available additional DD2 data include\n\nIDNC questionnaire data, a follow-up questionnaire from 2016 including (follow-up) questions from the initial questionnaire along with multiple questions concerning diabetic neuropathy.\nIDA, DICTA, CsubT2D, etc., are examples of projects initiated within DD2. These projects generate their own additional data and analyses but data are still part of the overall DD2 setup.\nQoL data. After enrollment, an e-mail with a questionnaire about quality of life (QoL) is sent to the individual. Additional follow-up questionnaires are sent after 2 years, 4 years, and 6 years.\n\nThese data sources will most likely not be routinely updated with new individuals or additional data, as they are primarily generated as part of specific research projects with closed cohorts. The data can be accessed through collaboration with DD2 research groups.",

A total of 6,726 questionnaires were sent out in June 2016 (07 June 2016), and a reminder was sent in September 2016 (12 September 2016) and again in October 2016 (10 October 2016) to those who had not provided a response.

For further information about the enrollment, please see the DD2 website (Danish): Patient information and Instructions and questionnaires.\n\n\n\n\nFigure from https://dd2.dk/om-dd2/hvem-er-med (downloaded 30 October 2025) showing the general practitioners and outpatient clinic enrolling individuals in DD2.\n\n\n\nThe first individual was enrolled in DD2 in November 2010. Between 2010 and April 2023, the DD2 cohort enrolled 11,381 individuals. An additional 717 individuals were enrolled by November 2023, yielding a total of N=12,098 individuals. In the 2024 cohort paper (Kristensen et al. (2024)), we illustrated the enrollment during the period from November 2010 to April 2023.\n\n\n\n\nFigure from Kristensen et al. (2024) with a total of N=11,369 individuals.  Overview of enrollment in the DD2 cohort from November 2010 to April 2023. The plots show the cumulative and annual number of enrolled individuals.\n\n\n\nThe median age at enrollment was 61 years (IQR 53–69 years) and 41% were women (Kristensen et al. (2024)). Individuals are eligible for inclusion in DD2 if they are diagnosed with diabetes within the last 2 years (a longer diabetes duration was allowed in the early phase). Median diabetes duration at time of enrollment was 1.3 years (IQR 0.4–2.9 years) and 87% were already prescribed with glucose-lowering treatment at the time of enrollment (Kristensen et al. (2024)).\nFor more information about the enrollment and data collection, please contact DD2.

The data set DS_EXT_DD2_POP includes all individuals with a valid CPR-number. Individuals with a non-valid CPR-number are still included in the uploaded data, e.g. in DS_EXT_DD2CORE, but they will have a missing encrypted CPR-number (CPR_ENCRYPTED) and can thus not be linked across data sources. Previously (when we had local data), we would notify DD2 (Odense) about non-valid CPR-numbers, but this is no longer possible as we are not allowed to identify the individuals based on individual-level data on the servers.\nThe data files uploaded by us have the prefix DS_EXT_. Data are available in 2 versions; the initial upload version (without suffix) and the updated versions (with suffix _230601, _231026, etc., corresponding to the date of the update on SDS). The registry data (views) will always be based on the newest population, i.e., individuals in the newest version of DS_EXT_DD2_POP.",

An “update” means that the population, and therefore also the registry data, has changed, and that the entire DD2 cohort should be seen as a new version. By “upload” we mean additional data uploaded to the current population. This could for example be adding analyses from the biobank or adding a new data source, i.e., something that doesn’t affect the population itself. The plan is to make one annual update (November/end of the year) and two to three additional uploads during per year.",

There are no dates in the dataset, but all analyses are performed on the enrollment samples. Data can be stratified by round using the variable data_round with values Gen1, Gen2, Gen3, and Tar1. A total of 14,089 different gene markers (or PRS or whatever they are) are currently included in the data. Data include 9,787*1,489=14,572,843 rows.\n\nIllustration of the overall data structure.
